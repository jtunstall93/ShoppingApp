# ShoppingApp

This was a small side project that I started to make a program for my mother to use to create and manage her shopping lists.
It has a variety of features, including saving and loading pre-made lists (assuming they're formatted correctly). You can edit
lists to update costs, locations, etc. You can also print the buy lists that are generated automatically. These can also be
texted to a phone (using the Twilio API) though this functionality is currently commented out due to the monetary costs.
